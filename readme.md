## Introduction

### Thonny

You will need Thonny to run and upload your Python code. Get it [here](https://thonny.org/).

## Python Basics

You can find a list of examples and descriptions on how Python code actually works [here](/python.md)

## Code Examples

Code examples can be found in the ["code"](/code) directory.

### basics.py

This code teaches the basics of Python programming including variables, if-statements and loops. Try this first!

### servo.py

This code demonstrates how to control an SG90 servo motor using a Raspberry Pi Pico. It utilizes the Servo library to simplify the servo control process. The code continuously rotates the servo between 0° and 90° positions with a short delay in between, providing a basic example of servo motor control.

#### Things to Try/Modify:

- Adjust the servo rotation angles
- Change the delay between servo rotations
- Add more servo positions

### servo-fade.py

This code demonstrates how to control an SG90 servo motor using a Raspberry Pi Pico and the Servo library. The code continuously rotates the servo between 0° and 90° positions in steps of 5°, creating a fading effect.

#### Things to Try/Modify:

- Adjust the servo rotation angles
- Change the delay between servo rotations
- Add more servo positions

### sensor.py

This code reads an analog sensor value and prints it to the command line every 0.3 seconds. It sets up an analog input pin, reads the sensor value as a 16-bit unsigned integer, and displays it. This allows monitoring the sensor's output and can be adapted for various sensors and projects.

#### Things to Try/Modify:

- Change the analog input pin
- Adjust the delay between sensor readings
- Modify the output format

### ultra-sound.py

This code demonstrates how to use an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) with a microcontroller board (like a Raspberry Pi Pico). It continuously measures the distance between the sensor and the nearest object in front of it. The measured distance is displayed in centimeters (cm) every 0.3 seconds.

#### Things to Try/Modify:

- Adjust the trigger and echo pin assignments
- Change the delay between distance measurements
- Modify the distance calculation formula

### library.py

Contains important code resources. Do not touch!

## Wiring

### Pinout Pi Pico

### Multiple Servos

## Prompting

When using ChatGPT or other GenAi to work on your code, integrate the following in your prompt:

```
<context>
we are using microphyton on a pi pico. make the code as simple as possible.
dont use any fancy python functionality. dont use defs/functions, consts, type annotations, records or array.
dont rewrite the code from ground up.
use only the libraries: "time" and "machine".
the code should be verbose without making things too complex. dont add extraneous comments. the code should explain itself.
if something is unclear (pins, timeframes etc) – ask before creating the code.

The pi pico has 28 GPIO pins going from GP0 to GP28. GP23-GP25 are NOT available.
GP26, GP27 and GP28 can also be used as ADC.

```

add a second led, if the value is 1 the first one should light up, if not the second led should light up.

current code:

```
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)
sensor = Pin(15,Pin.IN)

while True:

    value = sensor.value()
    print(value)
    if value == 1:
        led.value(1)
    else:
        led.value(0)
    sleep(0.1)

```
